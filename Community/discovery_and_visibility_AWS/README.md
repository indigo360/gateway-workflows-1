	role_assume = True
	aws_role_arn = <Insert AWS Role ARN>

- If the options are not pre-populated in the cloudatlas.conf then they can still be defined in Cloud Discovery workflow manually, setting the options in the application will write them back to the cloudatlas.conf file dynamically

# Advanced - Manually configuring SQS/CloudWatch Rules

If the AWS user has write permissions to SQS and Cloudwatch then the Initialise Visibility option under Visibility Options can be used to automatically create the required queue and rule.

If this fails due to the account not having write permissions to those services, please have the administrator configure the AWS SQS FIFO queue and CloudWatch Rule as below

- Create a FIFO SQS queue in your AWS region, called Bluecat.fifo

- Add a message group ID of Bluecat to the SQS queue

![alt text](id.png "id")

- Add a AWS CloudWatch Rule called Bluecat for EC2 event changes which points to the BlueCat SQS FIFO queue
